* BNF grammar for stcharts.el rendering/parsing

<chart>    ::= <title> "\n"
               "Ideal:\n" <ideal> "\n"
               <children> "\n"
               "Real:\n" <real> "\n\n"
               "Related charts:" "\n"
               <parents>

<title>    ::= <line>
<ideal>    ::= <lines>
<children> ::= <child> | <child> <children>
<real>     ::= <lines>
<parents>  ::= <parent> | <parent> ", " <parents>

<line>     ::= ^.*$
<lines>    ::= <line> "\n" <lines> | ""
<child>    ::= "- " <box> " " <title> "\n"
<box>      ::= "[ ]" | "[X]"

* Description of parser algorithm
Input: An Emacs buffer
Output: A plist with fields populated according to the buffer's contents

** What are the "borders"?
1. Title -> Ideal: "\nIdeal:\n"
2. Ideal -> Children: "\n\n"
3. Children -> Real: "\nReal:"
4. Real -> Parents: "\n\nRelated charts:"

** Dumb parser
- Create list containing above borders
- Set mark, Isearch buffer for next border
- (buffer-substring (mark) (point))
